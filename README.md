## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

The goal of this project is to make recommendations using various approaches such as:

* Rank Based Recommendations
* User-User Based Collaborative Filtering (neighborhood based method)
* Matrix Factorization (model based method)

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above recommendations approaches.

We also have the folder where the data is contained, in addition to the files used to test our functions that are in the notebook.
